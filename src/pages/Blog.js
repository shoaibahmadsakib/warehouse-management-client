        <h3>What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work?</h3>
        <p>
          JWT means JSON Web Token, which is an open standard used to share
          security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each
          JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are
          signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims
          cannot be altered after the token is issued.

            we use node js for creating a server-side environment. when we

            we use MongoDB for database for storing data and managing our data
